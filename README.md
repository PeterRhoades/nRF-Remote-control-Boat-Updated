# nRF-Remote-control-Boat-Updated
Remote control using NRF24 and digital servo for steering. I have used 2 NANO/NRF24 transmitter units one for speed and direction NANO_Boat_Motor_Transmitter_Ver1_2. The second for steering NANO_Boat_Stearing_Transmitter_Ver1_2. Both use the same data pipe to send a data array. The array holds the speed, direction and steering. Using two transmitters seems to give a much better data transmission. Both NANOâ€™s use a joystick connected to A0, one  NANO for forward reverse and speed. The second NANO for left, right and straight. The data is added to the arrays and sent to the receiver. The UNO receiver is connected to a motor driver and servo, this method seems to be 100% reliable. NANO_Boat_Motor_Stearing_Transmitter_Ver1 does both speed, direction, forward and reverse om one NANO. Wii_NunChuk_nRF24 one NANO connected to NunChuk full boat control. UNO_Boat_Motor_Stearing_Reciver_Ver1_0 take data from all sketches.
